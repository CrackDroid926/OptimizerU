        OptimizerU — Security Information
                Version: Alpha 1.0

==================================================

IS THIS PROGRAM A VIRUS?
NO. OptimizerU is an open-source system optimizer.
- Public source code at: https://github.com/Crackdroid926/OptimizerU  
- It contains no malware, spyware, cryptocurrency miners, or advertisements.
- It is 100% free and non-profit.

WHY DOES POWERSHELL OR COMMAND PROMPT OPEN?
The program needs to run Windows system commands to optimize your PC.  
This is done through:
  * PowerShell (an official Microsoft tool)
  * CMD (Command Prompt)
Both are standard components of Windows, just like File Explorer.

Examples of commands that are executed:
  * ipconfig /flushdns → Clears DNS cache
  * sfc /scannow → Repairs system files
  * powercfg -h off → Disables hibernation to free up disk space
  * del /q /f "%TEMP%\\*" → Deletes temporary files

WHY DOES IT REQUEST ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES?
Some optimizations (such as repairing the system, cleaning the Windows Update cache, or disabling services) require elevated privileges.  
This is normal and safe. If you don't trust it, you can:
  * Review the source code on GitHub
  * Run only "low-risk" optimizations
  * Use "Recommended" mode (safer)

FILES CREATED BY THE PROGRAM:
  * config.json → Saves your preferences (language, expert mode, etc.)
  * debug.log → Only if you enable "Debug Mode" (for developers)
  * INFO_ES.txt / INFO_EN.txt → This file and its Spanish version

POSSIBLE ERRORS AND SOLUTIONS:

1. Unable to create a restore point
   - System Protection must be enabled on your C: drive.
   - Go to: Control Panel > System > System Protection > Configure > Turn on.

2. "Access denied" when running optimizations
   - Run the program as administrator (right-click → "Run as administrator").

3. The interface looks broken or fails to load
   - Make sure you have updated Windows 10 or 11.
   - Install the latest updates for .NET Framework and Visual C++ Redistributable.

4. Optimizations have no effect
   - Some changes require restarting your computer.
   - Optimizations won’t "magically speed up" very old PCs, but they do improve stability and free up resources.

5. Can I undo the changes?
   - Yes: use the Restore Point created before optimization.
   - Or manually restore default settings (the program never modifies critical files without warning).

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- This program is specially designed for low-resource PCs (e.g., Intel Celeron, 2–4 GB RAM, HDD).
- "High-risk" optimizations are disabled by default.
- The risk level (Low / Medium / High) is always displayed for each option.
- The program never sends data to external servers.
